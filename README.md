# go2go

Welcome to the Goban Project! This project is a peer-to-peer Go game platform developed in Rust, featuring a server that manages game states and a client with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using WebAssembly (Wasm). The client is designed to run in the browser, providing a smooth and interactive experience for playing Go.

### Setup Instructions

### 1. **Compiling and Running the Server**

To run the server, navigate to the `server/` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cd server
cargo run
```

Alternatively, from the root of the workspace, you can specify the `server` package:

```bash
cargo run -p server
```

The server will start on `localhost:3030`.

### 2. **Compiling and Running the Client**

To build the client for WebAssembly, follow these steps:

1. **Install `wasm-pack`** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   cargo install wasm-pack
   ```

2. **Compile the Client**:

   Navigate to the `client/` directory and build the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   wasm-pack build --target web
   ```

3. **Serve the Static Files**:

   Install `http-server` (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

   Navigate to the directory containing your `index.html` and `pkg` folder, then run `http-server`:

   ```bash
   cd static
   http-server .
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   Open your web browser and go to the address provided by `http-server` (usually `http://localhost:8080`). You should see your WebAssembly-based Go game client.

## Features

- **Peer-to-peer communication**: The project supports peer-to-peer communication for a decentralized gaming experience.
- **WebAssembly client**: The client is built with Yew and compiled to WebAssembly, providing a modern and efficient web application experience.
- **Cross-platform**: The client can run on any platform that supports modern web browsers.
